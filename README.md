# microdata

  [schema.org](http://schema.org/) microdata parser for node.js.

  Tests based on tests in microdatajs by Philip JÃ¤genstedt.

## Installation

```
npm install @smhg/microdata
```

## Usage

```javascript
var microdata = require('microdata');

// parse html string
var result = microdata.parse('<html><!-- ... --></html>');

// parse url with callback
microdata.parse('http://www.something.tld', function(result) {
	// ...
});
```

## TODO
* return promise with Q
* parse more schema.org elements (e.g. time values)
* give meaning to itemprop values (Date, interval, Number)
* stream like sax.js
* optionally map itemtype values to something useful (other than url)
